# CHAT app

A simple client server app from the exercises in 'Do-It-Yourself Multiplayer Java Games: An Introduction to Java Sockets and Internet-Based Games'

Updated in parts for latest Java features i.e. streams, try with resources and i think lamdas might have been added too.

Planning to update the whole project and add tests for this simple chat app.

Ideally adding:
Testing (Any testing at all would be nice ;) )
Encryption
Security
